More than 20 trainees and PIs from the Sensorimotor Superlab at Western University contribute to this reading list. Here are the articles that have interested us this week.

Also this week we begin a new feature (see below): the Sensorimotor Superlab **Journal Club**. We will discuss a paper from the list, and invite one of the authors to give a presentation and answer questions. We will post a video of the meeting on YouTube, and we will post a link to the video here. We hope that you will find this interesting and useful.

Enjoy!
