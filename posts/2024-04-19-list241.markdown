More than 20 trainees and PIs from the Sensorimotor Superlab at Western University contribute to this reading list. Here are the articles that have interested us this week.   

Also this week we have a link to the talk that Superlab member Mehrdad Kashefi delivered at NCM 2024 in Dubrovnik, Croatia (see bottom of the list).

Enjoy!
