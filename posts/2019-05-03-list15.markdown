## 1
**Differentially synchronized spiking enables multiplexed neural coding**  
Lankarany, M., Al-Basha, D., Ratté, S., and Prescott, S.A.  
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1812171116](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1812171116)

## 2
**Visual Perception of Joint Stiffness from Multi-Joint Motion**  
Huber, M.E., Folinus, C., and Hogan, N.  
J. Neurophysiol. (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00514.2018](https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00514.2018)

An intriguing result that is perhaps a first step towards finding out if/how observers extract information related to mechanical impedance from vision of motion.

## 3
**The influence of task outcome on implicit motor learning**  
Kim, H.E., Parvin, D.E., and Ivry, R.B.  
Elife 8, e39882 (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.39882](https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.39882)

## 4
**Memory formation in the absence of experience**  
Vetere, G., Tran, L.M., Moberg, S., Steadman, P.E., Restivo, L., Morrison, F.G., Ressler, K.J., Josselyn, S.A., and Frankland, P.W.  
Nature Neuroscience (2019)  
[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0389-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0389-0)

Sounds like science fiction for sure, and raises some interesting questions about the nature of experience and memory. An amazing technical tour-de-force worth reading. See the [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/franklandlab/status/1122898899906310144?s=11) for more.

## 5
**Spatial and Temporal Locomotor Learning in Mouse Cerebellum**  
Darmohray, D.M., Jacobs, J.R., Marques, H.G., and Carey, M.R.  
Neuron (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.01.038](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.01.038)

Another paper from the Carey lab ([@meganinlisbon](https://twitter.com/meganinlisbon)), which is doing some really amazing work on motor learning in a mouse model of split-belt treadmill locomotion.

## 6
**Neural Signatures of Prediction Errors in a Decision-Making Task Are Modulated by Action Execution Failures**  
McDougle, S.D., Butcher, P.A., Parvin, D.E., Mushtaq, F., Niv, Y., Ivry, R.B., and Taylor, J.A.  
Curr. Biol. (2019)  
[https://www.cell.com/article/S0960982219304099/abstract](https://www.cell.com/article/S0960982219304099/abstract)

## 7
**Obtaining and maintaining cortical hand representation as evidenced from acquired and congenital handlessness**  
Wesselink, D.B., van den Heiligenberg, F.M., Ejaz, N., Dempsey-Jones, H., Cardinali, L., Tarall-Jozwiak, A., Diedrichsen, J., and Makin, T.R.  
Elife 8 (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37227](https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37227)

## 8
**Responses of somatosensory area 2 neurons to actively and passively generated limb movements**  
London, B.M., and Miller, L.E.  
J. Neurophysiol. 109, 1505–1513 (2013)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00372.2012](https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00372.2012)

From 2013—Clear and well-written, it’s enjoyable to read.

## 9
**Titin force is enhanced in actively stretched skeletal muscle**  
Powers, K., Schappacher-Tilp, G., Jinha, A., Leonard, T., Nishikawa, K., and Herzog, W.  
J. Exp. Biol. 217, 3629–3636 (2014)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.105361](https://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.105361)

Kiisa Nishikawa gave a great talk at NCM this year in Toyama, Japan. In this paper from 2014 she and her colleagues continue to challenge the sliding filament-based cross-bridge model of muscle contraction, and describe the role of the elastic protein called titin in generating force in active muscle.
