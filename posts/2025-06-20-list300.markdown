Trainees and PIs from the Sensorimotor Superlab at Western University contribute to this reading list. Here are the articles that have interested us this week.  

This week we continue our Journal Club feature (see below). In our lab meeting we discuss a paper from the list, and invite one of the authors to give a presentation and answer questions. We post a video of the meeting on YouTube, and we post a link to the video here.  

Enjoy!

# Journal Club

We recently welcomed two guest speakers to our sensorimotor superlab lab meetings:

Mohammad Amin Fakharian from the Shadmehr Lab at Johns Hopkins presented a recent paper, "**A vector calculus for neural computation in the cerebellum**". Now out in Science: [https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu6331](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu6331).  
**Video**: [https://youtu.be/SV4qdMvsOIU](https://youtu.be/SV4qdMvsOIU)


Ariel Rokem (University of Washington) showed us **the latest and greatest in tract tracing via MRI, especially as it relates to development** ([https://neuroinformatics.uw.edu/publications](https://neuroinformatics.uw.edu/publications)).
