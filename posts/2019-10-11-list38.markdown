## 3
**Reward-based improvements in motor control are driven by multiple error-reducing mechanisms**  
Codol, O., Holland, P.J., Manohar, S.G., and Galea, J.M.  
bioRxiv, 792598 (2019)

**Minimizing Precision-Weighted Sensory Prediction Errors via Memory Formation and Switching in Motor Adaptation**  
Oh, Y., and Schweighofer, N.  
J. Neurosci. (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3250-18.2019](https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3250-18.2019)

Internal models are updated to minimize sensory prediction errors which result from the mismatch between the predicted and measured sensory consequences of an action. Oh and Schweighofer address whether an error should lead us to create an entirely new internal model, update an existing perturbation model, or update the model of the body. They propose a novel model of adaptation which uses multiple precision-weighted prediction errors for memory creation, selection, and updating. —SC
