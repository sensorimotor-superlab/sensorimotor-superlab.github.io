# Join the SuperLab

Are you interested in graduate school or a postdoc in sensorimotor neuroscience?  
Apply to the Sensorimotor SuperLab.

We have a number of open positions for **Graduate Students** interested in pursuing studies within one of the many research projects currently underway in the [Gribble](https://gribblelab.org) lab.

We are also searching for a **Postdoctoral Fellow** to work on a specific project involving cerebellar imaging: [https://www.diedrichsenlab.org/open_postdoc_cerebellum.htm](https://www.diedrichsenlab.org/open_postdoc_cerebellum.htm). Experience with behavioral work in humans, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or computational modeling are desired.

Other **Postdoctoral Fellow** positions are also available in the [Gribble](https://gribblelab.org) and [Pruszynski](https://pruszynskilab.com) labs.

For more details and for application instructions please see: [https://superlab.ca/join](https://superlab.ca/join)
