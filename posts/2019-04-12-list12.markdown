A very good blog-style post on gaussian processes. It's easy to read and has some nice interactive figures.


# Superlab Publications
Here we list new papers by members of the sensoriomotor superlab:


**Sequence learning is driven by improvements in motor planning**  
Ariani, G., and Diedrichsen, J.  
J. Neurophysiol.  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00041.2019](https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00041.2019)

In two behavioral experiments, we used a sequence production task to uncover elementary components of skilled motor performance. We show that performance improvements are not fully explained by faster single-item selection, nor improved motor execution. Instead, much of the learning can be attributed to an enhanced ability to plan multiple sequence elements into the future.


**The effect of response complexity on simple reaction time occurs even with a highly predictable imperative stimulus**  
Maslovat, D., Klapp, S.T., Forgaard, C.J., Chua, R., and Franks, I.M.  
Neurosci. Lett. 704, 62–66 (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2019.03.056](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2019.03.056)

# Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that the appearance of a paper on our reading list should not necessarily be considered an endorsement of the work unless of course we explicitly endorse it, for example in a blurb. These are just papers that have caught our attention this week. As always, please read papers with a critical eye.
