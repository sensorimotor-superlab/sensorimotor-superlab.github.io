Welcome to the 99th (!) Reading List. As we begin our winter break, we have decided to also take a break from the Reading List, and return in January with a special 100th edition to launch the new year. The 100th edition is slated to appear on Friday January 22nd. Have a safe holiday break.

Here are the articles that we have been reading this week.

Enjoy!
