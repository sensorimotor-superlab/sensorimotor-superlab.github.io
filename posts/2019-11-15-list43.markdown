**Haptic assistance that restricts use of redundant solutions is detrimental to motor learning**  
Lokesh, R., and Ranganathan, R.  
bioRxiv, 819771 (2019)  
[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/819771v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/819771v1)

Each time you bring your mug of coffee to your lips while reading our list this morning, your arm moves in subtly different ways from sip to sip. Precise repetition of motor actions is extremely uncommon in ecological behavior, but robot-assisted therapies often enforce very precise movements. In light of this contrast, Lokesh and Ranganathan investigate whether people can learn a novel motor task as effectively when such natural variability is curtailed using a robot. —SR
