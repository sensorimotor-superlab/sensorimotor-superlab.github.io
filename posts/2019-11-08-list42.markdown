**Efference copy is necessary for the attenuation of self-generated touch**. 
Kilteni, K., Engeler, P., and Henrik Ehrsson, H.  
bioRxiv, 823575 (2019)  
[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/823575v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/823575v1)

It is well established that tactile stimulation from self-produced movements feels less intense than externally produced stimulation of matched intensity. Kilteni and colleagues investigated whether an efference copy is required for this sensory suppression to occur or whether attenuation can also result from the predictable contact of a passively moved limb. The authors showed that sensory attenuation only occurred when stimulation was produced by the actively moving limb, thus supporting the view that an efference copy is necessary for the sensory attenuation of self-produced touch. —CF
