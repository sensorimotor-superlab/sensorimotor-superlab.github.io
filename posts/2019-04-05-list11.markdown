Here are the articles that caught our attention this week.

Enjoy!  
---Paul, Andrew & Jörn


## 1
**What, if anything, is the true neurophysiological significance of rotational dynamics?**  
Lebedev, M.A., Mill, N.A., Urpi, N.A., Cervera, M.R., and AL Nicolelis, M.  
bioRxiv, 597419 (2019)  
[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/597419v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/597419v1)

A saucy paper about how to interpret so-called "rotational dynamics" observed from population recordings, for example in primary motor cortex. Also see this [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/JonAMichaels/status/1113438118143623168) about related papers by Michaels et al. and by Sussillo et al.:

**Neural Population Dynamics during Reaching Are Better Explained by a Dynamical System than Representational Tuning**  
Michaels, J.A., Dann, B., and Scherberger, H.  
PLoS Comput. Biol. 12, e1005175 (2016)  

**A neural network that finds a naturalistic solution for the production of muscle activity**  
Sussillo, D., Churchland, M.M., Kaufman, M.T., and Shenoy, K.V.  
Nat. Neurosci. 18, 1025–1033 (2015)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4042](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4042)

**The increase in muscle force after 4 weeks of strength training is mediated by adaptations in motor unit recruitment and rate coding**  
Del Vecchio, A., Casolo, A., Negro, F., Scorcelletti, M., Bazzucchi, I., Enoka, R., Felici, F., and Farina, D.  
J. Physiol. 597, 1873–1887 (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1113/JP277250](https://dx.doi.org/10.1113/JP277250)

An interesting sEMG decomposition method (reported in Martinez-Valdez et Al. 2017, see below) allows Del Vecchio and colleagues to track individual motor units longitudinally during strength training. Profiling these adaptations at the motor unit level provides new clues regarding the physiology underlying rapid #gainz.

**Tracking motor units longitudinally across experimental sessions with high-density surface electromyography**  
Martinez-Valdes, E., Negro, F., Laine, C.M., Falla, D., Mayer, F., and Farina, D.  
J. Physiol. 595, 1479–1496 (2017)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1113/JP273662](https://dx.doi.org/10.1113/JP273662)

**Human electrocortical dynamics while stepping over obstacles**  
Nordin, A.D., Hairston, W.D., and Ferris, D.P.  
Sci. Rep. 9, 4693 (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41131-2](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41131-2)

Tracking brain dynamics during running and hurdling over obstacles. Also see the [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/Ferris_vball/status/1107674431994953728).

[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582874v1.abstract](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582874v1.abstract)

## 5
**Subthalamic nucleus and sensorimotor cortex activity during speech production**

J. Neurosci. (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2842-18.2019](https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2842-18.2019)

## 6

## 8
**Temporal signals underlying a cognitive process in the dorsal premotor cortex**  
Rossi-Pool, R., Zizumbo, J., Alvarez, M., Vergara, J., Zainos, A., and Romo, R.
