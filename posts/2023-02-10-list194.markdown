# Join the SuperLab

Are you interested in graduate school or a postdoc in sensorimotor neuroscience?  
Apply to the Sensorimotor SuperLab.

We have a number of open positions for **Graduate Students** interested in pursuing studies within one of the many  research projects currently underway in the [Diedrichsen](https://www.diedrichsenlab.org/) / [Gribble](https://gribblelab.org) / [Pruszynski](https://www.pruszynskilab.com/) labs. We are particularly interested in recruiting students who want to work collaboratively between labs.

We are also searching for a **Postdoctoral Fellow** to work on a specific project studying the neural control of sequential movements. Experience with behavioral work in humans, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or computational modeling are desired.

For more details and for application instructions please see: [https://superlab.ca/join](https://superlab.ca/join)
