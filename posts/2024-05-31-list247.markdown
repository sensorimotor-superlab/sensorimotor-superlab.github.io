More than 20 trainees and PIs from the Sensorimotor Superlab at Western University contribute to this reading list. Here are the articles that have interested us this week.  

This week we continue our new feature (see below): the Sensorimotor Superlab **Journal Club**. In our lab meeting we discuss a paper from the list, and invite one of the authors to give a presentation and answer questions. We post a video of the meeting on YouTube, and we post a link to the video here.

Enjoy!
