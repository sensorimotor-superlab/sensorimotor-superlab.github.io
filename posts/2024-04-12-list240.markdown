More than 20 trainees and PIs from the Sensorimotor Superlab at Western University contribute to this reading list. Here are the articles that have interested us this week.  


In addition we have a special section devoted to posters and talks being presented by Superlab members at the 2024 Neural Control of Movement meeting in Dubrovnik, Croatia, next week. Check it out.  


Enjoy!
