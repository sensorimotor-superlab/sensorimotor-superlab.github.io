Each Friday we will publish a list of 10 papers that we have seen over the past week that have sparked our interest. They may be new or they may be oldies-but-goodies. They may be published in journals, or preprints on arXiv or bioRXiv. They may be blog posts or GitHub code repositories.

Here is this week's list:

1. Berniker, M., and Penny, S. (2018). [A normative approach to neuromotor control](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00422-018-0777-7). Biol. Cybern.

2. Biswas, D., Arend, L.A., Stamper, S.A., Vágvölgyi, B.P., Fortune, E.S., and Cowan, N.J. (2018). [Closed-Loop Control of Active Sensing Movements Regulates Sensory Slip](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.11.002). Curr. Biol.

3. Dhakal, V., Feit, A.M., Kristensson, P.O., and Oulasvirta, A. (2018). [Observations on Typing from 136 Million Keystrokes](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174220). In Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (ACM), p. 646.

4. Hardwick, R.M., Forrence, A.D., Krakauer, J.W., and Haith, A.M. (2018). [Time-dependent competition between habitual and goal-directed response preparation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/05/201095). bioRxiv, 201095.

5. Hoffman, B.U., Baba, Y., Griffith, T.N., Mosharov, E.V., Woo, S.-H., Roybal, D.D., Karsenty, G., Patapoutian, A., Sulzer, D., and Lumpkin, E.A. (2018).

# Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that the appearance of a paper on our reading list should not necessarily be considered an endorsement of the work unless of course we explicitly endorse it, for example in a blurb. These are just papers that have caught our attention this week. As always, please read papers with a critical eye.
