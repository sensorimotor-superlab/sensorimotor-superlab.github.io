Political drama continues here in Canada, and things are heating up in the U.S. and Britain as well. Take a break and read some science. Here are some articles that interested us this week, including an essay by Eve Marder in eLife on the importance of writing in a scientist's life, and many concrete suggestions about how to write a clear paper.

1. Marder, E. (2019). [Love writing](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45734). eLife 8, e45734.

   A wonderful essay on the important of loving writing, as a scientist, and concrete suggestions about how to write better papers and grants.

2. Arcaro, M., Schade, P.F., and Livingstone, M.S. (2019). [Body-map proto-organization in newborn macaques.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/565390v1) bioRxiv, 565390.

3. Baechinger, M., Lehner, R., Thomas, F., Hanimann, S., Balsters, J.H., and Wenderoth, N. (2019). [Motor fatigability as evoked by repetitive movements results from a gradual breakdown of surround inhibition.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/569608v1.abstract) bioRxiv, 569608.

   This describes a new visualization tool for large artificial neural networks with the goal of helping us humans understand how the network represents the information that it has learned.
