A "timely" read for the neuroscience community (it's only a few years later). The key takehome is that we need richer tasks to capitalize on the advancements made in neural recording technology. The authors demonstrate that recording more neurons (without increasing the complexity of the task) does not mean the true dimensionality of your data increases. Importantly, this is also used to address the concern that by sampling only a portion of neurons, we might under sample the true dimensionality. Therefore, better insights can be gained with more careful consideration of the tasks we use, and not necessarily by simply increasing the number of neurons we record.
