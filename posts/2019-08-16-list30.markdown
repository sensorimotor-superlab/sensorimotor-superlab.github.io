Here are the articles that we are reading this week.

Enjoy!  
---Paul, Andrew & Jörn

## 1
Matic, A., and Gomez-Marin, A.  
**A customizable tablet app for hand movement research outside the lab**  
J. Neurosci. Methods, 108398 (2019)  
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108398](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108398)

Powerful, low-cost computers and open source software may dramatically alter how and where movement science is conducted in the near future. Matic and Gomez-Martin present straightforward templates for designing finger or stylus tracking experiments on Android tablets. While planar recordings of stylus/finger movements sacrifice data richness compared to 3D and/or multi-segment recordings, the portability and low cost of tablets make this an attractive option when ease of setup is a primary concern.
