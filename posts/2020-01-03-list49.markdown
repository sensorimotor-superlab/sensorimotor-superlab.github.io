**DLTdv digitizing tool: MATLAB tools for digitizing video files and calibrating cameras**  
Hedrick, T  
[http://biomech.web.unc.edu/dltdv/](http://biomech.web.unc.edu/dltdv/)
This is a software package that has existed for over 10 years and previously focused on video digitizing; version 8 adds deep learning tools for automated markerless tracking. The package is available in MATLAB but also as compiled binaries which you should be able to use even if you don't have MATLAB or the deep learning toolbox. A paper describing some of the inner workings of the digitizing package can be found here: —SR
