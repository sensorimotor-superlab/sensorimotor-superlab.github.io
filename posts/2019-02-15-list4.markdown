Here is our reading list for the week, featuring a new paper by our own Jeff Weiler [@Jeff_Weiler](https://twitter.com/Jeff_Weiler) in Nature Neuroscience:

1. Weiler, J., Gribble, P.L., and Pruszynski, J.A. (2019). [Spinal stretch reflexes support efficient hand control.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0336-0) Nat. Neurosci.

   We show that there is a spinal feedback pathway that integrates somatosensory feedback from the wrist and the elbow, ‘understands’ how this multi-joint feedback maps onto the hand’s location in external space, and is able to generate elbow muscle activity that supports postural hand control.

2. Gerwin, L., Haupt, C., Wilkinson, K.A., and Kröger, S. (2019). [Acetylcholine receptors in the equatorial region of intrafusal muscle fibers modulate mouse muscle spindle sensitivity.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1113/JP277139) J. Physiol.

3. Lieber, J.D., and Bensmaia, S.J. (2019). [High-dimensional representation of texture in somatosensory cortex of primates.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1818501116) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.

   The authors describe a complex, high-dimensional representation of texture in somatosensory cortex, the structure of which does a good job accounting for texture perception. The complexity arises because S1 neurons idiosyncratically detect specific spatial and/or temporal aspects of the peripheral input.

4. Maheu, M., Dehaene, S., and Meyniel, F. (2019). [Brain signatures of a multiscale process of sequence learning in humans.](https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41541) Elife 8.

5. Parrell, B., Ramanarayanan, V., Nagarajan, S., and Houde, J. (2019). [The FACTS model of speech motor control: fusing state estimation and task-based control.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/543728v1) bioRxiv, 543728.
