## 10
**Neurobehavioural signatures in race car driving**  
Lima IR, Haar S, Di Grassi L, Aldo Faisal A  
bioRxiv:860056 (2019)  
[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/860056v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/860056v1)

When we purport to study ecological actions, we often reduce their complexity by constraining behaviour and/or recording only a few variables of interest. In distict contrast to this approach, Lima and Colleagues present a rich dataset (including EEG, eyetracking, and kinematics) recorded from a professional racecar driver driving a high performance car on a racetrack. As technology for recording neurobehavioural data becomes more portable and robust, datasets like this will be easier to obtain; how can we design experimental paradigms to take advantage of high dimensional data without analysis and interpretation becoming even more of a bottleneck? —SR
