The cold weather is here. Stay in and read some papers! Here is our list this week:

1. de la Malla C, Brenner E, de Haan EHF, and Smeets JBJ (2019). [A visual illusion that influences perception and action through the dorsal pathway](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-019-0293-x). Communications Biology 2, 38.

2. Giri B, Miyawaki H, Mizuseki K., Cheng S., and Diba K. (2019). [Hippocampal reactivation extends for several hours following novel experience](https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1950-18.2018). J. Neurosci. 39(5):866-875

3. Parra LC, Haufe S, and Dmochowski JP (2018). [Correlated Components Analysis - Extracting Reliable Dimensions in Multivariate Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08881). arXiv stat.ML.

   This paper coins the term 'wedge projection neurons', units in the fly brain that integrate signals across the two antennae, and receive input from several kinds of second-order neurons to produce a linear-ish representation of wind direction.
