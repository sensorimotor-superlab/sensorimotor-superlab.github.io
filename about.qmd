We are the Sensorimotor Superlab at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca) in [London](http://www.london.ca/), [Ontario](https://www.ontariotravel.net/en/home), [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en.html).

The Superlab combines the labs of [JÃ¶rn Diedrichsen](https://www.diedrichsenlab.org), [Paul Gribble](https://www.gribblelab.org), and [Andrew Pruszynski](https://www.pruszynskilab.com).

Every Friday we publish a weekly reading list---papers from the literature that have caught our eye over the past week. They may be brand new publications or they may be oldies-but-goodies. They may be published in journals, they may be preprints on arXiv or bioRXiv. They may even be blog posts or GitHub code repositories.

If you would like the reading list sent to you each week by email, please [subscribe here](subscribe.qmd).

Enjoy!
